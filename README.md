# ANZ-F5-Engage
 
This repo is created for the ANZ F5 Engage event and documents the better together solution - **Delivering Container Ingress with F5 Container Ingress Services and NGINX Kubernetes Ingress Controller**

## Introduction

The F5 Container Ingress Services (CIS) can be integrated with the NGINX Plus Ingress Controllers (NIC) within a Kubernetes (k8s) environment.

The benefits are getting the best of both worlds, with the BIG-IP providing comprehensive L4 ~ L7 security and DNS services, while leveraging NGINX Plus as the de facto standard for micro services solution.
